# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Fuel-Efficient-Driving
This project implements Q-learning from scratch to solve the OpenAI Gym’s MountainCar-v0 with state (position, velocity) discretization and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. Includes a custom reward shaping function, training over 1,000 episodes.
